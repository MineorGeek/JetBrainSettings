      <item value="Thanks for your confirmation，we’ll double check with our related colleague.  But may I know 5:00 BJT is the final ending time in the following HK IPOs? Or just because it’s during the system test period which you referred to yesterday?" />
      <item value="At this stage we are closing specific HK IPOs at 05:00 BJT to facilitate our testing.  Once we have reviewed the impact on all the related processes/operations we will communicate what you can expect going forward.  Hopefully we will be in a position to confirm later next week." />

      <item value="Although Dapper shares many of its high-level ideas with systems such as Pinpoint and Magpie, our implementation contains a number of new contributions in this space." />
      <item value="The value of Dapper as a platform for development of performance analysis tools, as much as a monitoring tool in itself, is one of a few unexpected outcomes we can identify in a retrospective assessment." />
      <item value="Since Dapper has been in production and operating at large scale for years now, we decided it would be most appropriate to focus this paper on what Dapper’s deployment has taught us, how our design decisions played out, and in what ways it has been most useful." />

      <item value="These systems tend to be described in the research literature at a very early       point in their development, before there is an opportunity to clearly evaluate important design choices." />

The letter-labeled nodes represent processes in a distributed system.  point in their development, before there is an opportunity to clearly evaluate important design choices." />
      <item value="The design space of distributed systems tracing tools has been explored in a number of excellent previous articles, among which Pinpoint [9], Magpie [3] and X-Trace [12] are most closely related to Dapper." />
      <item value="We have found that Dapper’s system-wide data often focuses a performance investigation so that other tools can be applied locally." />
      <item value="Making the system scalable and reducing performance overhead was facilitated by the use of adaptive sampling, as will be described in Section 4.4." />
      <item value="An additional design goal is for tracing data to be available for analysis quickly after it is generated: ideally within a minute. Although a trace analysis system operating on hours-old data is still quite valuable, the availability of fresh information enables faster reaction to production anomalies." />
